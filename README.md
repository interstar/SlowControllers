# SlowControllers : VCV Template 

"Slow Controllers" are software controllers where the user's momentary gestures lead to events extended in time. For example, a particular gesture can trigger a whole arc of algorithmically generated notes, or a sweep of filter and other effect parameters. The aim is to provide players with the ability to construct larger, more complex pieces of music in an improvisational setting. 


This repository is for a number of experimental interfaces to sound and music in the format of [VCV Modules](https://vcvrack.com) based on the [VCV Plugin Tutorial](https://vcvrack.com/manual/PluginDevelopmentTutorial.html).
